Analysing data and finding the bias of a coin
Suppose I have a personal communication system which can transmit or receive bits.
My friend tossed a coin some n times where n is large.
He sent me a 0 when tail comes up and 5 when head comes up.
The signal that I received from my friend was corrupted by some noise.
Finding bias of the coin from this noise corrupted data.
